This project is the first code I've ever written in Go.

I've been doing a lot of work with Hyperledger Fabric using a proprietary stack and I wanted to try it with a new stack: https://kaleido.io/

I also wanted to try a different language, since Hyperledger Fabric has SDKs for TypeScript, Java, and Go.

This code is me muddling my way through a new language and putting some of the basic pieces in place for a game I will then put on a blockchain.

Normally I wouldn't make code like this public, but it may eventually become part of a contract that will be publicly visible - so why not?
